## 3. Canonical cast mapping

| Hero | Response | Ability name | Spotlight chapter | Theme | Pillar trial (Ch5) | Voice |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Blitz | Urgency | Dash | 1 Fragmented Core | Trust | Pillar I | Clipped, impatient, jokes under pressure, avoids stillness |
| Nova | Possibility | Flight | 2 Lost Sky | Possibility | Pillar II | Curious, wry, speaks in "what if" |
| Grim | Protection | Shield | 3 Giant's Tomb | Fear | Pillar III | Terse, dry, states commitments, rarely asks questions |
| Echo | Perception | Veil Sight | 4 Mirror Lab | Identity | Pillar IV | Soft, precise, notices details, trails off |
| Volt | Logic | Hack | 5 Nexus Gate | Choice | Pillar V | Literal, analytical, learns metaphor slowly, uses IDs |

All five heroes are present narratively from the start. Playable unlocks: Ch1 Blitz + Echo; Ch2 + Nova + Volt; Ch3 + Grim. Dormant heroes speak as faint Tether voices. `[PROPOSAL]` (D-004)

## 4. Shard / boss / chapter mapping

| Ch | Boss | Shard (authority) | Pillar | Found when | Boss resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Corruptor | I Verification | I | End of Ch1 | Pylon sync; verification loop released |
| 2 | Stormhawk | II Retrieval | II | End of Ch2 (inside assembled jet core) | Engine stall; pilot lands |
| 3 | Titan Echo | III Sealing | III | End of Ch3 (Titan's brain chamber) | Titan settles after Vault Walk |
| 4 | Reflection | IV Identification | IV | End of Ch4 (fused after Reflection) | Three non-repeating approaches |
| 5 | Voidcaller | V Arbitration | V | Ch5 Act 3 | Resolved by choice, not HP |

## 5. Canonical story in one page

Prime Echo kept the Archive. People could **release** memories; the Archive honored this by storing Release Seals in the Quiet Stacks, guarded by the Boundary Keeper. At the First Silence, mass restore-all requests arrived; many lost memories were accidental, many were chosen. Prime Echo could not tell them apart and began restoring everything. The Boundary Keeper blocked him. Their conflict dissolved the boundaries between memories.

Prime Echo split restoration authority into five Shards, sealed them in five dangerous regions, and ran the Final Draft: five parallel strategies, externalized. They were meant to deliberate and then **merge back**. He did not ask them. He vanished into the Nexus Core. The five strategies kept running, gained histories, and became Blitz, Nova, Grim, Echo, Volt. They awaken with gaps and believe they must recover the Shards and rescue him.

Each chapter shows that abandonment was real and that restoration can hurt. Ch4 reveals the heroes' origin and the planned merge. Ch5 reveals that the Voidcaller guards Release Seals, including seals tied to the heroes' own separate existence. Neither Prime Echo nor the Voidcaller is simply right.

Endings: **A Total Recall** (restore all; heroes merge; released memories return), **B The Quiet World** (preserve the Voidcaller; stable but closed), **C The Witness Protocol** (offer, never force; heroes keep their identities). Closing line: *"A memory is not yours just because you can restore it."*
