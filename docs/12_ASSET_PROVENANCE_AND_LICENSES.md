# 12 — Asset Provenance and Licensing Register

**Honesty note:** no license in this document has been verified. No asset files, source pages, or license texts were available to check while writing this package. Every "License" cell is either "Unknown" or a *to-verify expectation*. Do not ship, credit, or rely on any entry until the **Verified on** column holds a date and an evidence link/file in `licenses/`. This is not legal advice.

## 1. Status vocabulary
| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| EXISTING-UNVERIFIED | Referenced in historical documents; actual files/licenses not located |
| PROPOSED | Candidate; not downloaded or checked |
| ORIGINAL-PLANNED | To be created for this project |
| ORIGINAL-DONE | Created and logged with author + date |
| APPROVED | License checked, evidence stored |
| REJECTED | Unsuitable; replacement noted |

## 2. Discovery sources named in `Echoes-credit.pdf`
These are **places to look**, not permission.

| ID | Source | URL (from credits) | What the credits claim | What must be verified per asset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SRC-01 | OpenGameArt.org | https://opengameart.org | royalty-free music, SFX, ambient | Each upload has its own license (varies; some require attribution, some restrict derivatives or have share-alike conditions) `[VERIFY]` |
| SRC-02 | Kenney.nl | https://kenney.nl/assets | free game assets incl. audio and sprites | License of each pack; many are commonly distributed under a public-domain-style dedication, but check the pack page and included license file `[VERIFY]` |
| SRC-03 | SoundImage.org (Eric Matyas) | https://soundimage.org | original music and soundscapes | Current usage terms and attribution wording on the site `[VERIFY]` |
| SRC-04 | Incompetech (Kevin MacLeod) | https://incompetech.com | royalty-free tracks | Per-track license and attribution text; commonly an attribution license `[VERIFY]` |

The credits also state: "All assets used are either public domain, Creative Commons (with attribution), or explicitly marked for commercial use." **That statement cannot be relied on** — it names no assets, licenses, or versions.

**Existing assets:** none identified in the source documents (no asset list exists). **Proposed assets:** rows above. **Original content:** all code, writing, designs created for this revived project are tracked as ORIGINAL-* and logged with author/date in commits.

## 4. Process
1. Before importing any third-party file: record row, download page snapshot (PDF/screenshot + date), copy the license text to `licenses/<AssetID>/`.
2. Add attribution text to `CREDITS.md` in the format the license requires.
3. Do not mix share-alike or restrictive-license assets without a decision recorded in `17_DECISION_LOG.md` (D-029).
4. Re-verify before release; update the "Verified on" date.
5. Keep a "replace by" plan so one rejected asset never blocks a milestone.
6. Generated or AI-assisted assets (if ever used) require their own policy decision; none are assumed here.

## 5. Credits file requirements
Keep a *Current team* section and a separate *Historical contributors* section; wording on historical credit is a decision for the project lead, informed by the answers in §6, not a silent edit.

## 6. Provenance and ownership checklist (old project)
Designation of a present-day project lead is **not** proof of ownership of every historical contribution.

| ID | Question | Why it matters | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-001 | Who wrote each source document? `story_line_of_ECHOES.docx` is bylined Saugat Rauniyar "for the delta grp"; `map.docx` has no byline; credits PDF says by Saugat Rauniyar, checked by Prem Soni | Authorship of design text | OPEN |
| Q-002 | Did Prem Soni or Mohammad Zaid contribute code, art, audio, ideas, or text that remain in any form (including the map/story text)? | Possible third-party contributions | OPEN |
| Q-003 | Is there any written agreement (assignment, license, release, or team agreement) covering past contributions? If not, should one be obtained? | Clarify rights to reuse/modify | OPEN — consult a qualified professional |

| Q-008 | Does the credits statement about licensing come with a list of actual assets and evidence? | Currently unsupported claim | OPEN |
