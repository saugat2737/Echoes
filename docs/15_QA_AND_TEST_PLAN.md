# 15 — Quality Assurance and Test Plan

No tests have been run and no benchmarks exist. Performance numbers below are **targets with assumptions**, not results. Test IDs: `T-<area>-n`.

## 1. Approach
Automated: unit + headless integration for deterministic logic. Manual: feel, readability, fairness. Playtests at Gate A, Gate B, Gate C (`13`). Every bug gets the template in §14.

## 2. Gameplay tests
| ID | Test | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T-GP-1 | Complete rooms 1.1–1.6 without hints | Completable; times logged |
| T-GP-2 | Each room's intended solution (per `04` §16) | Solves |
| T-GP-3 | Each room's reset | Returns to authored state <3 s |
| T-GP-4 | Fairness checklist PF-1…PF-10 per room | All pass |
| T-GP-5 | New tester observation (no instructions) | Goal understood in < 30 s |

## 3. Physics and collision tests
| ID | Test | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T-PH-1 | Same scripted input twice → same position per tick | Identical |
| T-PH-2 | Jump apex, coyote, buffer values | Within ±5% of config |
| T-PH-3 | Dash into wall/ledge/one-way | No tunneling |
| T-PH-4 | Moving platform carry | Player stays on platform; no jitter |
| T-PH-5 | Framerate independence (simulate 30/60/144 render) | Same result (physics fixed 60 Hz) |

## 4. Echo Trace determinism tests
| ID | Test | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T-TR-1 | Golden run: record scripted inputs, replay 100× | Zero tick deviation |
| T-TR-2 | Trace length = TR-01; stops automatically | Yes |
| T-TR-3 | Short (<0.5 s) recording | Discarded with cue |
| T-TR-4 | Cancel (hold) | Nothing spawned; no cooldown |
| T-TR-5 | Slot replacement (2 slots) | Oldest replaced |
| T-TR-6 | Hold then dissolve timings | TR-03/TR-06 |
| T-TR-7 | Record while on moving platform `[PROTOTYPE]` | Documented behavior |

## 5. Puzzle reset and fail-state tests (edge cases)
| ID | Case | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T-PZ-1 | Trace dissolves while player stands on plate it was holding | Plate releases; warning cue; no soft-lock |
| T-PZ-2 | Hero swap during replay | Trace continues with recorded hero abilities |
| T-PZ-3 | Player dies during boss phase | Respawn at boss Beacon; phase reset; no stuck state |
| T-PZ-4 | Puzzle becomes unsolvable after reset | Never; reset restores authored state (automated solve-after-reset test) |
| T-PZ-5 | Trace launched when target invalid | Event skipped, "broken echo" cue |
| T-PZ-6 | Seam crossing with live trace | Trace dissolves; layout toggles |
| T-PZ-7 | Replay overlapping player on switch | Weight sums correctly |
| T-PZ-8 | Quit mid-puzzle then continue | Puzzle state restored per spec (reset to room start) |

## 6. Character ability tests
Per ability: duration, cooldown, limits, interaction with Static Fields, replay behavior (AC lists in `03`). Examples: T-AB-1 dash cooldown escalation and reset; T-AB-2 flight energy; T-AB-3 shield noise suppression; T-AB-4 veil reveal radius; T-AB-5 hack target validity.

## 7. Boss behavior tests
| ID | Test |
|---|---|
| T-BS-1 | Scripted boss run: each state reachable; transitions follow `03` |
| T-BS-2 | Corruptor Shade path equals recorded path |
| T-BS-3 | Sync Window passes with trace strike and manual strike |
| T-BS-4 | Telegraph ≥ 0.5 s for all attacks |
| T-BS-5 | No unavoidable damage (frame-step audit) |
| T-BS-6 | Reflection default script deterministic with a fixed ledger |

## 8. Save/load tests
Round-trip all fields; corrupt file → backup → new game flow; version migration test; save during boss prohibited (Beacon-only); three slots independent.

## 9. Checkpoint tests
Respawn state (Integrity, room reset), Beacon between boss phases, Beacon placement ≤ 60 s of progress.

## 10. Accessibility tests
Remapping all actions; hold/toggle; colorblind palettes (simulated); reduced glitch/flash (no >3 flashes/s); subtitles; independent audio sliders; Assist presets (Sync Window, trace length, noise sensitivity); no mic dependency.

## 11. Performance targets (assumptions)
- 60 FPS at 1080p on a mid-range desktop (min spec TBD `[VERIFY]`).
- Frame spikes: investigate any > 25 ms during gameplay.
- Load between rooms: target < 2 s `[assumption]`.
Record actual measurements per milestone in `docs/perf/`.

## 12. Regression testing
Run the automated suite on every commit/merge; run the T-TR golden test and slice acceptance checklist before every milestone exit; keep a "known fixed bugs" list with a test per bug.

## 13. Chapter 1 vertical slice acceptance tests

| # | Criterion | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| S-1 | Movement and jumping feel | 5/5 testers rate "responsive" (≥ 4/5) |
| S-2 | Blitz dash | Gap + pulse trap crossable; cooldown escalates |
| S-3 | Echo Trace | Records, launches, holds plate; determinism test green |
| S-4 | Complete environmental puzzle | Room 1.3 and 1.5 solvable unaided by ≥ 4/5 testers |
| S-5 | Enemy interaction | Sentry baited, stunned, released |
| S-6 | Boss prototype | Corruptor P1–P2 beatable in ≤ 3 min median |
| S-7 | Checkpoints and recovery | Death restores correctly; ≤ 60 s lost |
| S-8 | Progression | 1.1 → 1.6 with autosave |
| S-9 | Visual/audio sample | Representative palette, parallax, 1 ambient + 1 boss cue |
| S-10 | Length | 10–15 min median `[VERIFY]` |
| S-11 | Accessibility baseline | Remap + hold/toggle + reduced effects |
