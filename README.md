# ECHOES: THE THINGS WE CHOSE TO FORGET

An original 2D puzzle-platformer built in Godot 4.x (GDScript). Revival and pre-production of a previously abandoned concept. **Designated project lead / creative director:** Saugat Rauniyar (an operational designation, not a verified statement of IP ownership; see `docs/12_ASSET_PROVENANCE_AND_LICENSES.md` §6).

**Pitch:** record your own past as a ghost, use it to solve puzzles in a dream-realm of forgotten memories, then decide whether every memory deserves to come back.

## Status
Documentation phase. No production code yet. Nothing in `/docs` has been playtested, benchmarked, or legally reviewed.

## How decisions are tracked
Every change to canon or design goes into `docs/17_DECISION_LOG.md` with an ID, reasoning, alternatives, and consequences. If any doc conflicts with `00B`, fix the doc.

## Tags
`[SOURCE]`, `[CANON]`, `[PROVEN-PATTERN]`, `[PROPOSAL]`, `[PROTOTYPE]`, `[VERIFY]` (defined in `00B` §1).

## Start with
**Milestone M1 (concept and design lock)**, then **M2 (movement prototype)**, then **M3 (Echo Trace prototype)**. Begin with backlog tasks BL-001 to BL-020.

## START HERE
1. Answer the provenance questions Q-001–Q-010 and seek qualified advice on historical contributions.
2. Create the repo and pin the Godot version (BL-001, BL-002).
3. Build the movement prototype and fix scale/camera (BL-004–BL-006).
4. Build the Echo Trace prototype with the determinism golden test (BL-010–BL-015) and decide at Gate A.
5. Start the asset register with evidence files before importing any third-party asset (`docs/12`).
